title: Evaluating and assessing the model
---

# Assessing and evaluating the reconstructed 3D shape

In this last part we continue to probe our model by performing posterior predictive checks. 
We also compare different models and assess the influence of factors such as the choice of prior distribution and other modelling assumptions. 

### Contents:

* Posterior predictive checks [Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO)
* Understanding and comparing multiple models [Slides](../TODO)


### Learning goals

The participants

* can perform prior predictive checks
* know a variety of techniques to assess the properties and limits of their fitted models 
* understand the full Bayesian workflow for shape modelling and can apply it to other inference problems.
