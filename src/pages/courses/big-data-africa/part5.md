title: Evaluating and assessing the model
---

# Reconstruction from real data

In this last part the participants apply their modelling pipeline to real data and assess the performance
and limitations of the model. They also quantify the uncertainty of their model prediction

### Contents

* Evaluating a fitted model and comparing multiple models ([Slides](https://github.com/shape-the-world/big-data-africa-23/raw/main/slides/model-evaluation.pdf))
* Practice: Fit the model to real-data (Continue working on Jupyter-notebook from [part4](/courses/big-data-africa/part4))


### Learning goals

The participants
* can use the developed components to derive a solution that works on real data.
* know a variety of techniques to assess the properties and limits of their fitted models.
* can assess the uncertainty inherent in the model.
* understand the full Bayesian workflow for shape modelling and can apply it to other inference problems.
