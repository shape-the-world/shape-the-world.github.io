# 3D from 2D Reconstruction of Vertebra on Fake data

In this part we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting for 3D from 2D reconstruction. 
We start by using simulated contours, which we know the model can explain, and use this data 
to calibrate our method and to detect computational problems. Once the pipeline is up and running we 
run it on real data.

#### Learning goals

The participants

* Understand the main building blocks for fitting a shape model.
* can fit their shape model of the vertebra to simulated 2d contours.
* know how to use simulated data to evaluate and assess fitting problems.
