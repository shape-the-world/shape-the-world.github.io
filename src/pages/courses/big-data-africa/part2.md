# Modelling of vertebra shapes 

In this part of the project we apply the steps that we performed for our toy example to 
a generative model of 2D contours of 3D shapes. Equally important, we assess the expressive power and limitations of our model 
though prior-predictive checks.


### Contents:

* Modelling shapes [Slides](../TODO)
* Prior predictive checks for the shape models [Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO)
* Analysis-by-synthesis [Slides](../TODO)
* Rendering 2D contours from 3D bones [Slides](../TODO)
* A generative model for 2D contours [Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO)


### Learning goals

The participants
* understand shape models as a probability distribution 
* can visualize samples from the shape model and know how to perform predictive checks to assess model quality
* understand the analysis-by-synthesis approach and the role of generative models 
* can perform predictive checks for the complete generative model
