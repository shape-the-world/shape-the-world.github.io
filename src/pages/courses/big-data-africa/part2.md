# Modelling of vertebra shapes 

In this part of the project we apply the steps that we performed for our toy example to 
a generative model of 2D contours of 3D shapes. Equally important, we assess the expressive power and limitations of our model though prior-predictive checks.


### Contents:

* Modelling shapes ([Slides](https://github.com/shape-the-world/big-data-africa-23/raw/main/slides/shape-modelling.pdf))
* Generative modelling vertebra shapes and contours ([Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/shape-the-world/big-data-africa-23/blob/main/notebooks/shape-modelling.ipynb))


### Learning goals

The participants
* understand shape models as a probability distribution.
* can visualize samples from the shape model and know how to perform predictive checks to assess model quality.
* can perform predictive checks for the derived shape and contour model and can assess the model quality and impact of the prior distributions.
