title: Introduction to the Bayesian workflow

# The Bayesian workflow and generative modelling

In this first part of the course, we give an introduction to the Bayesian workflow, which provides the 
conceptual guideline that we will follow in this project. We then start to apply the concepts into practice
by working on a simple toy problem. This will on one hand build up the intuition for the work on the real project, 
but also introduce the participants to the programming environment and Scala.

### Learning goals

The participants

* understand the purpose of a principled workflow in shape and image analysis 
* know the steps of the Bayesian workflow and how they fit together
* know the steps involved in creating a generative model 
* can apply techniques to check the validity of a prior model
* can read scala code and use ready made components to build larger programs
