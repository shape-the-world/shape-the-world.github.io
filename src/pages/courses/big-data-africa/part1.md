title: Introduction to the Bayesian workflow

# The Bayesian workflow and generative modelling

In this first part of the course, we give an introduction to the Bayesian workflow, which provides the 
conceptual guideline that we will follow in this project. We then start to apply the concepts into practice
by working on a simple toy problem. This will on one hand build up the intuition for the work on the real project, 
but also introduce the participants to the programming environment and Scala. 

### Contents:

* What is the Bayesian workflow ([Slides](../TODO))
* Example Problems: Measuring Hands ([Slides](../TODO))
* Prior predictive checks ([Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO))
* Data visualization and Prior Modelling ([Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO))


### Learning goals

The participants

* understand the purpose of a principled workflow in shape and image analysis 
* know the steps of the Bayesian workflow and how they fit together
* know what a generative model is and how to check its validity
* can do prior predictive checks
* can read scala code and use ready made components to build larger programs
