# Big Data Africa School 2023 - Course Project 


### 3D from 2D reconstruction using Gaussian Process Morphable Models

This page holds all the lecture material for the course project 
*3D from 2D reconstruction using Gaussian Process Morphable Models*, as presented
at the [Big Data Africa School - 2023](https://www.sarao.ac.za/students/4th-big-data-africa-school/). 


### Contents

In this project, the participant will work on the problem of 3D from 2D reconstruction of a vertebra from a single 2D contour using statistical shape models. This task has various applications from surgery planning 
to diagnosis and is of particular interest in settings where costs or other resources prohibit the use of 
acquiring a 3D scan. More importantly, however, the course attempts to teach an arguably more important, learning goal: The participants will follow a principled Bayesian workflow and learn a set of principles and 
methods, which lead to applications that can be trusted and understood independently of the specific  data-analysis task. 


#### Day 1: Generative modelling and the Bayesian workflow
- [Part 1](/courses/big-data-africa/part1): Introduction to the Bayesian workflow and generative modelling
- [Part 2](/courses/big-data-africa/part2): Generative modelling of vertebra shapes and 2D contours

#### Day 2: Fitting a model
- [Part 3](/courses/big-data-africa/part3): Probabilistic model fitting 
- [Part 4](/courses/big-data-africa/part4): 3D reconstruction from 2D of Vertebrae on simulated data

#### Day 3: Evaluating a fitted model
- [Part 5](/courses/big-data-africa/part5) : 3D reconstruction on real data


### Target audience and prerequisites

The participants should have passed a first course in probability theory and statistics. No prior exposition to Bayesian statistics is assumed. 
The course project will be written using the programming language *Scala*. While no previous experience in *Scala* is required, the participants should have strong programming skills, preferably in a 
strongly typed language such as Java, C# or C++.


### Literature and additional resources

The general approach is greatly inspired by the excellent course (and textbook) [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath.

#### Research papers

The following two papers provide the conceptual foundation for the project

- Gelman, Andrew, et al. "Bayesian workflow." arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.01808 (2020) [(pdf)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808)
- LÃ¼thi, Marcel, et al. "Gaussian process morphable models." IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence 40.8 (2017): 1860-1873. [(pdf)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8010438/)

#### Software

As a basis for all the practical parts we will use the Open Source Software library Scalismo. 

- Scalismo - Scalable Image and Shape Modelling ([Webpage](https://scalismo.org/), [Github](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo))
