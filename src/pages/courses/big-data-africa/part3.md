# Fitting probabilistic models

In this part of the course we look at the problem of model fitting using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. 
We discuss the basic concept and apply it to our toy problem. We will see the value of fake data simulations and 
how they help us to assess whether the computational procedures yield a faithful approximation of the true posterior.
