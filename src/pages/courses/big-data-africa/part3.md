# Probabilistic fitting 

In this part of the course we look at the problem of model fitting using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. 
We discuss the basic concept and apply it to our toy problem. We will see the value of fake data simulations and 
how they help us to assess whether the computational procedures yield a faithful approximation of the true posterior. 


### Contents:
* Probabilistic fitting and Metropolis-Hastinsg [Slides](../TODO)
* Fitting in 2D [Jupyter-Notebook](../TODO)
* Diagnosing problems using fake data simulations


### Learning goals

The participants
* understand the main ideas behind Monte-Carlo sampling
* understand the building blocks for sampling in Scalismo and can adapt them to solve bigger problems
* can do fake data simulations to diagnose fitting problems.
