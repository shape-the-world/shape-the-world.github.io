# Data preparation
<!--
* Important to organize the data properly. 
* Use data repository 

### Data repository

In order to make later changes to the system simple, we organize the 
data in a data-repository and only manipulate data to the 
functions provided by the repository

Note that while the triangle meshes do have color associated with the vertices, we 
only use shape
