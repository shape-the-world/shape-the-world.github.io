# Model building

* Introduction
    * Explain context of vertebra case study and its goals
    * Shape model and intensity and therefore tetrahedral

* Data 
    * Data screening 
    * Initial Reference selection
    * Building an atlas of each vertebra

* Establishing correspondence
    * The choice of prior gp model (prior predictive checks)
    * Initial alignment
    * Validating the registrations

* Getting a stable mean by iterating

* GPA Alignment (normalizing size and pose)

* Building the Intensity model 

* Evaluating model
    * (prior predictive checks)
    * Quantitative metrics
