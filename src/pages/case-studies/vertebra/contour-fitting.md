    * Where do contours come from
    
* Simulating x-ray
    * Setup of sensor plane, source, object, ....
    * perspective projection
    * finding contours on the 3D mesh

* Size and discussing the need for a calibration 

* Validating the fitting model 
    * Forward path: generate some contours

* Testing the computations
