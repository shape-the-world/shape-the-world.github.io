Welcome to shape-the-world - a place where shape modelling theory meets
practice. 

We have just published a draft of a comprehensive [case study](/case-studies/vertebra/vertebra/) on vertebra modelling
and 2D/3D reconstruction for obtaining BMD measurements from X-Ray images. The pipeline resulted 
from joint work with Prof. Tinashe Mutsvangwa, Division of Biomedical Engineering, University of Cape Town.
